//! historica-remark's CI, as one program.
//!
//! Every job the CI workflow runs is one entry in [`JOBS`] and one
//! `cargo xtask <id>` invocation. The workflow itself holds no build knowledge:
//! it asks `cargo xtask ci-matrix` what the jobs are, then runs each one by id.
//! Adding, renaming, reordering, or retiring a job is an edit to this file and
//! nothing else — the YAML does not change.
//!
//! Locally, `cargo xtask ci` runs the same jobs in the same order against the
//! same commands, so a green run here is a green run there.
//!
//! Cutting a release does not live here. It is `dx <command>`, the shared
//! tooling configured by `.config/release.toml` — the same tool
//! prov, twig, leaf, flower, and the other historica repos all cut releases
//! with, because five copies of one program is five places for it to drift.
//!
//! There are no dependencies on purpose. Every CI job builds this crate before
//! it can start, so its build time is paid several times over per push.
