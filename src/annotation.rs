//! The remark itself — *a reader's mark on somebody else's document.*
//!
//! The model is the W3C Web Annotation Data Model's, because that is where
//! the experience of anchoring a remark to text that may later change was
//! paid for: a **target** (what is annotated), a **selector** (which part —
//! the quoted text with a little of what surrounds it), a **motivation**
//! (why), a **body** (what the reader said), and a **state** (which version
//! of the target the reader was looking at).
//!
//! Its serialisation is not borrowed. JSON-LD nesting is the wrong shape for
//! a metadata block a person edits, so a remark is an ordinary document whose
//! metadata is flat and typed:
//!
//! ```yaml
//! target: ark:12345/dxk7f2q9wl/bcdfgr   # the annotated document, durably
//! at: 3f9ce1                            # the revision the reader saw
//! exact: "we had no idea the lake would freeze"
//! prefix: "That winter "
//! suffix: " and Dad laughed"
//! motivation: questioning
//! color: yellow
//! ```
//!
//! and whose body is the remark. A highlight is a remark with no body.
//!
//! # Why the fields are quoted and the format is fig's
//!
//! `exact`, `prefix`, `suffix` and `replacement` are verbatim slices of
//! somebody's prose. Their edge whitespace is the point — the prefix above
//! ends in a space, the suffix begins with one — and a format that trimmed
//! them would produce an anchor that silently stops matching, in the one piece
//! of machinery whose whole job is surviving an edit. They may also contain
//! newlines. So the carrying format has to quote, and fig's quoted scalars
//! are that rule already written and already tested; inventing a line grammar
//! here would mean inventing an escape rule beside it.
//!
//! # Editing
//!
//! `editing` is the one motivation that proposes a change rather than saying
//! something about the passage — the Web Annotation model's own term for a
//! reader requesting an edit to the target. It is a patch, and it is shaped
//! like one:
//!
//! ```yaml
//! target: ark:12345/dxk7f2q9wl/bcdfgr
//! at: 3f9ce1                            # the base — required, for an edit
//! exact: "the red bouy"                 # what to replace
//! prefix: "rowed out past "
//! suffix: " before"
//! motivation: editing
//! replacement: "the red buoy"           # what to replace it with
//! ```
//!
//! The replacement lives in the metadata, quoted, for the reason the selector
//! does: it is prose whose edge whitespace and newlines are the proposal. The
//! body stays what it is everywhere else — what the reader said, here about
//! *why* — and may be empty. An empty `replacement` is a deletion; an
//! insertion quotes the neighbouring text and gives it back with the new
//! words inside it, so there is no second selector kind to anchor.
//!
//! Three things every other motivation may leave out are required of an
//! edit, and a document that calls itself one without them is
//! [`Error::Unreadable`]: the base revision, because a patch without a base
//! is a guess; a selector, because this crate does not define a whole-document
//! patch; and the replacement itself. The converse holds too — a
//! `replacement` on a comment is a document that says two things about
//! itself.
//!
//! [`apply`] is the pure half of taking one: anchor the selector in a text
//! and splice the replacement in, reporting the anchor so the caller can see
//! whether it was certain. Whether a given anchor is certain *enough* — and
//! whether the person proposing it may have it applied without a hand — are
//! policies, and they belong to whoever holds the store.
//!
//! # Why the target is opaque
//!
//! A remark's target is by design in *another* store than the one the remark
//! lives in — the author's, of which the reader holds a fetched copy and
//! never the original. What identity means across that gap is the caller's
//! question, not this crate's: a Diaryx vault names documents by ARK, a
//! static site by URL, a corpus by DOI. So a target is a string here, and
//! what counts as one is a [`TargetCheck`] the caller hands to a [`Reader`].
//!
//! # Anchoring
//!
//! [`anchor`] is the Web Annotation `TextQuoteSelector` rule: find the quoted
//! text, prefer the occurrence its context agrees with, and say how sure that
//! was. Whether the items the reader quoted still *exist* at head, and where
//! they moved to, is the layer above this one ([`crate::layer`]) and needs
//! the store; this function needs only the text.
