//! Carrying a chain away — *the store as a set of objects, and the manifest a
//! reader fetches by.*
//!
//! Historica's own transport is two decisions: `export` builds the copy a
//! stranger should have (0042/0052 — the target's ancestry, closed, with the
//! forgetting that touches it, and without the bookmarks and rules marked
//! private), and `offer` lists that copy so a fetcher can ask for exactly
//! what it lacks (0048) — every entry named by the digest of its bytes, so
//! nothing arrives unverified. Neither needs a server that does anything but
//! hand back a file it was asked for by name.
//!
//! What a *publish* adds is that the names must not be paths and the bytes
//! must not be readable in transit or at rest. So the export is written into
//! memory rather than onto disk, and what leaves here is the manifest text
//! plus every file it lists, keyed by digest — which is what a sealing layer
//! names and encrypts. Every digest is content-addressed, so an unchanged
//! history seals to unchanged objects and a republish uploads only what
//! moved; a file the new manifest no longer lists (a forgetting's destroyed
//! original) is one the publish deletes.
//!
//! An [`Export`] is also a [`Source`] in its own right, which is the
//! plaintext transport: two chains on one disk, a test, a courier trusted
//! with the bytes — and what a sealed transport becomes once it has unwrapped
//! the objects.
//!
//! # What travels beside the revisions
//!
//! Nothing this crate arranges. Historica carries a reserved directory by its
//! class (decision 0053), and its registry says `claims/` travels and
//! `trust/` does not — so the signed claims that vouch for a chain are in the
//! offer as `reserved` entries, named by the digest of their bytes like
//! everything else, and a fetch verifies them like everything else.
//!
//! That is worth stating because the obvious alternative is wrong. A tool
//! could carry claims *beside* the offer, in an index of its own, on the
//! reading of 0046 that leaves claims-in-an-export to the tool. It would
//! work, and every byte of it would arrive unverified — the offer is what
//! names a file by its digest, so a file the offer does not list is a file
//! nothing checks. Letting historica carry them is both less code and the
//! only version that is safe.
//!
//! And `trust/` staying home is not an omission to be fixed later. A claim
//! arriving says *here is a fact*, which commits this copy to nothing; an
//! opinion about a key arriving would say *believe more*, and a copy seeded
//! with a stranger's key verifies the stranger's history. Believing a key is
//! a person on this machine deciding, and nothing else.
