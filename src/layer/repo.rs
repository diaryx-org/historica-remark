//! One kept chain — *somebody else's history, fetched into a directory of

//!
//! The shape is historica's own, unreshaped: the writer's documents

//!     history/          the store
//!         remark/       this crate's notes — see NOTES_DIR
//! ```
//!
//! A [`Repo`] is a path and nothing else; constructing one touches no disk.
//!
//! # What a receive is
//!
//! historica's `fetch` (its decision 0048): the store asks the source for the
//! manifest, takes exactly what it lacks, verifies every file against the
//! digest the manifest names it by, and complies with any forgetting that
//! arrives — so a line the writer withdrew is destroyed here on the next
//! receive, without anybody on this side being asked. The store is then
//! materialised at its head so the files can be read as files.
//!
//! A source that is not a continuation of what this store already holds is
//! refused rather than merged: a single-writer chain that has become another
//! chain is a different history, not a newer one.
//!
//! # What is read out of it
//!
//! Remarks, chiefly — every document at the head that declares a `target` and
//! reads as an [`Annotation`]. A document that declares a target and cannot
//! be read as a remark is passed over rather than reported: it is the
//! writer's mistake, in the writer's chain, and the reader has no way to mend
//! it.
